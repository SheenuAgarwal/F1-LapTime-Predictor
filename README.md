# F1 Lap Time Predictor üèéÔ∏èüí®

Welcome to the **F1 Lap Time Predictor** repository! This project builds a machine learning model to predict Formula 1 qualifying lap times. We utilize telemetry, weather, tyre, and driver performance data to make accurate predictions. Our model is trained on data from 2021 to 2025 (up to the Monaco Grand Prix) and focuses on predicting the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix in 2025.

## Project Overview

The F1 Lap Time Predictor project aims to provide fans, teams, and analysts with a tool to forecast lap times based on various influencing factors. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we analyze historical data to generate insights and predictions for upcoming races.

### Why Predict Lap Times?

Predicting lap times can help teams make strategic decisions during races. Understanding how factors like weather and tyre performance affect lap times can provide a competitive edge. This project contributes to sports analytics by providing a model that can enhance decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses advanced algorithms to predict lap times.
- **Data Analysis**: Offers insights into the impact of different variables.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and utilize.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Trained on extensive datasets from multiple seasons.

## Data Sources

The model uses a variety of data sources, including:

- **Telemetry Data**: Information gathered from car sensors during races.
- **Weather Data**: Conditions that can affect performance, such as temperature and humidity.
- **Tyre Performance**: Data regarding the performance of different tyre compounds.
- **Driver Performance**: Historical data on individual driver performance metrics.

### Data Collection

Data was collected from various online repositories and official Formula 1 statistics sites. The datasets cover the seasons from 2021 to 2025, ensuring a robust training foundation for our model.

## Modeling Techniques

We employ several machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions:

### Random Forest Classifier

The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training. It improves prediction accuracy and controls overfitting.

### Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is used to handle multicollinearity in datasets. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which helps in maintaining model simplicity while improving prediction accuracy.

### XGBoost

XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that excels in structured data. It combines the benefits of gradient boosting and regularization to enhance model performance.
